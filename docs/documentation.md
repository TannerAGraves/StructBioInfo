## Dependencies

It is assumed that `Python 3.x` is already installed.

Before running the software, make sure all the following dependent Python libraries are installed on your machine:

- `biopython`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `imblearn`
- `keras`
- `tensorflow`

For visualization after training are also required:

- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

To install all, run: `pip install biopython numpy pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn keras tensorflow matplotlib seaborn` 

If you find python3 is not able to find the libraries, install them using the following command: `python3 -m pip install biopython numpy pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn keras tensorflow matplotlib seaborn`

Additionally, `DSSP` has to be installed. On Ubuntu, run: `sudo apt-get install dssp`.



## Running the Software

The software allows:
- out-of-the-box prediction by loading the pretrained model.
- complete retraining of the model.

### Prediction Mode

- _Requires_: PDB code of target protein (referred below as `your_pdb_id`)
 
To run the software as default, run the following command in your terminal, using arguments:

`python3 contact_net.py --predict --pdb your_pdb_id`

- By default, the software will output the `.csv` file to only contain the subset of preprocessed features used for inference, as passed to the model. 
- If you want the output `.csv` file to contain the subset of unpreprocessed features used for inference, use the `--unprocessedfeats` argument.
- If you want the output `.csv` file to contain all the features from `calc_features.py`, use the `--full` argument when running the command instead. However, make sure `DSSP` is correctly installed, otherwise the output `csv` file will have blank values on `DSSP`-dependent calculated features. 

*Usage Example*: 
- run `python3 contact_net.py --predict --pdb 5yj5`. This will generate the standard `csv` output prediction file.
- run `python3 contact_net.py --predict --pdb 5yj5 --unprocessedfeats`. This will generate the `csv` output prediction file with unprocessed features.
- run `python3 contact_net.py --predict --pdb 5yj5 --full`. This will generate the full-unprocessed-featured `csv` output prediction file.


Note that all generated files can be found in the `data/output/` folder. 

The software will download the pdb in .mmCIF format, compute its features using the `calc_features.py` script and import the corresponding generated `.tsv` file. In case the `.tsv` file is not found, the software will notify this and terminate its execution. Otherwise, the software will preprocess the data and run it through the pretrained model to predict the contacts.

Once finished, the DataFrame containing the protein's features will be merged with the one containing the probability distribution of each contact being of a certain type, giving more information about the confidence of the prediction.

The software will finally export the final `pdb_id_pred.csv` file in the `data/output/` folder. 

### Training Mode

To train the model from scratch, run the following command:

`python3 contact_net.py --train`
