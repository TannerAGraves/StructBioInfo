Authors: Tanner Graves, Marco Uderzo, Nour Alhousseini, Hazeezat Adebimpe Adebayo.

## Repository Overview and Files

The repository is organized as follows (only relevant files and folders mentioned):

```
â†³ data: folder containing all data.
        â†³ features_ring: folder containing all of the training data in .tsv format.
                        ðŸ—Ž *.tsv

        ðŸ—Ž atchley.tsv: utility file to compute features.
        ðŸ—Ž ramachandran.dat: utility file to compute features.

â†³ docs: folder containing the software documentation.
        ðŸ—Ž documentation.md: software documentation.

â†³ model: folder containing the trained model, loaded at inference time.
        ðŸ—Ž model.keras: keras model file.
      
ðŸ—Ž contact_net.py: main python script. run for inference or training, specifying arguments.
ðŸ—Ž model.py: python script containing the untrained model.
ðŸ—Ž calc-features.py: python script to compute the proteins features.
```

## Dependencies

Before running the software, make sure all the following dependent python libraries are installed on your machine:

- `Python 3.x`: assuming it's already installed.
- `biopython`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `imblearn`
- `keras`

To install all, run: `pip install biopython numpy pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn keras` 

If you find python3 is not able to find the libraries, install them using the following command: `python3 -m pip install biopython numpy pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn keras`



## Running the Software

The software allows both out-of-the-box inference by loading the trained model or complete retraining of the model.

### Inference Mode

- Require: pdb_id
 
To run the software as default, run the following command in your terminal, using arguments:


`python3 contact_net.py --inference --pdb_id`

TODO: Explain the .csv output

### Training Mode

To train the model from scratch, run the following command:

`python3 contact_net.py --train`
